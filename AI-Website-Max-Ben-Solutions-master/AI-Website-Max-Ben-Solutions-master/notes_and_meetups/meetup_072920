Weekly Meeting:

Discussed flask progression towards data input and how it works on a local host. 

Invited Joe to create a nice html/css shell once production is coming out. This will be in about 3-5 weeks.

Will be continuing to improve flask development so that user can safely upload files that are "not" illegal or in bad nature to our side.

Next meet up is Friday the 31st
