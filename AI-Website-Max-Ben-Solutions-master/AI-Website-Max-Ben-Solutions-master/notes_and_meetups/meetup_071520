Today's session (discussing goals and progress)

Discussed how 

- group by certain columns that have appropriate data types such as obj, int64

-  max's approach to read files using the glob function and then dissect the data
	 and then to manipulate, create permutations with columns and writing back to
	 an Excel file (.xlsx)

- some issues that we were running into were the writing back to excel files using	appropriate clause. 

Next Objective :

Meet next Wed (7/22)

- accomplish a clean notebook that starts with accepting a user input for 
	basic data groupby, if they would want permutation (cartesian product), or
  a more sophisticated analysis such as ML Feature Importance.

- create functions that are callable and can gracefully manipulate, create eda, and write back to an Excel File.
